I"O<p><strong>Stratosphere</strong> is a pretty cool box with an <strong>Apache Struts vulnerability</strong> in which endpoints ending with .action, .go, .do can be injected with a specially crafted Content-Header leading to Remote code execution. The exploit doesn’t give us a shell, So I went on with <strong>Dumping MySQL database without an interactive shell</strong> which gives me user’s password. For root, We have to exploit a python script which I did in two ways: <strong>Python library hijacking</strong> and exploiting <strong>vulnerable python2 input()</strong> function.</p>
